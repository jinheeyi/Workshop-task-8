## Introduction
I apologize for not completing this work for 8 and 9, due to because of the time and plus watching the workshop lectures. Please do understand, I don't have a PC of my own, only but the old lenevo computer that my parents use. So it was a bit of struggle to myself, going back and forth finishing up the codes and even writing the readme.file too. But it was quite a experience for almost all the workshops that I did during these weeks. Let me know if you see this, thank you very much.
